# aitho-navbar
This is an exercise provided by AITHO, it consists in replicating learn.aitho's navbar in static HTML/CSS code.
In addition, I was requested to use Bootstrap classes and jQuery to make a few functions.

# functions
I was asked to create functions that when clicking on the "?" button it would show an alert with a message, and when clicking on the bell icon it would hide itself.
These functions should then become promises.

# Set Up
- Clone git repository
- Open the index.html file
